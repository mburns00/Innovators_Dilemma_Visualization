# Innovator's Dilemma Interactive Visualization

This React component creates an interactive visualization of Clayton Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma theory. It demonstrates how disruptive technologies evolve to overtake established products despite rational decisions by incumbent companies.

## Features

- **Animated timeline** showing performance trajectories of incumbent and disruptive technologies
- **Interactive popups** explaining key concepts at milestone points
- **Case study selector** for exploring real-world examples like Netflix vs. Blockbuster
- **Manual timeline slider** for precise navigation
- **Detailed explanations** of specialized terminology (S-curves, organizational ambidexterity, etc.)
- **Strategy insights** for both incumbents and disruptors

## Implementation

The visualization uses React with the Recharts library and includes pause/play functionality, tooltips, and responsive design. Suitable for educational purposes, business strategy courses, or technology management presentations.

## Key Concepts Explained

- **High-margin customers**: Profitable clients willing to pay premium prices for better performance
- **Non-consumption**: Markets where people aren't using any solution yet
- **Organizational ambidexterity**: The ability to simultaneously explore new opportunities and exploit existing capabilities
